## 🧠 Project Overview  

This Power BI project presents an in-depth analysis of **Telangana State’s weather conditions** over a period of **four years (2021–2024)**.  
The goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights into **rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed** patterns across Telangana’s districts and mandals, helping understand **seasonal trends, anomalies, and correlations** among key weather metrics.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Areas  

The analysis was divided into **five main dashboards**, each answering a specific set of questions:

### 🌧️ **1. Rainfall Analysis**
- Which district received the highest average rainfall?  
- How rainfall varies monthly across mandals and seasons  
- Rainfall trends over years and identification of high-intensity periods  
- Annual rainfall comparison between districts  
- Detection of anomalies and calculation of monthly rainfall percentages  

### 🌡️ **2. Temperature Insights**
- Average min and max temperature per district  
- Seasonal and annual temperature trends  
- Daily temperature range and extreme events  
- Correlation between min and max temperature  

### 💧 **3. Humidity Patterns**
- Average humidity variation across districts and seasons  
- Detection of anomalies and extreme humidity levels  
- Yearly humidity trends and daily ranges  

### 🌬️ **4. Wind Speed Analysis**
- Average min and max wind speeds by district  
- Monthly wind speed variations  
- Outlier detection for extreme wind speeds  
- Yearly trend of wind patterns  

### 🌈 **5. Comprehensive Weather Dashboard**
- Unified view of all major weather parameters  
- Correlation between rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind  
- Seasonal and yearly summary of key metrics  
- Detection of extreme weather events

## 📈 Insights Derived  

- **Rainfall:** Northern districts like *Adilabad* and *Nizamabad* received consistently higher rainfall than southern regions.  
- **Temperature:** Summer months (April–June) recorded the highest max temperatures, while winter months had the largest temperature range.  
- **Humidity:** Coastal and central regions exhibited higher humidity, especially during monsoon periods.  
- **Wind Speed:** Western Telangana showed slightly higher average wind speeds, with occasional high-speed anomalies in specific mandals.  
- **Overall Trends:** Weather parameters followed consistent seasonal cycles with minor anomalies attributed to specific years.
